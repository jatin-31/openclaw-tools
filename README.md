# OpenClaw Tools

This is my public repo for tools that I've built for OpenClaw.

I lean heavily on Claude Code (and now Codex) to develop these.

The main reasons I build my own skills:
* To avoid the wretched hive of scum and villainy that currently permeates ClawHub
* To learn by doing (or at least directing code agents)
